Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial, a prominent financial institution, is actively pursuing measures to bolster the security of its current web application. Recognizing the critical importance of safeguarding sensitive financial data and ensuring the trust of its clients, Artemis Financial is investing resources into fortifying their web application against emerging cyber threats and vulnerabilities. By enhancing security protocols, implementing robust encryption methods, and continuously monitoring for potential risks, Artemis Financial aims to maintain a secure and resilient digital platform for their clients' financial transactions and data interactions. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Coding securely is paramount in today's digital age, particularly for protecting the personal data of clients and users. By implementing robust security measures in coding practices, organizations can effectively mitigate the risk of data breaches that could tarnish their reputation and undermine customer trust. A breach not only jeopardizes sensitive information but also exposes individuals to potential identity theft and financial fraud, leading to profound repercussions for both users and the company. Therefore, prioritizing secure coding practices, such as proper input validation, secure authentication mechanisms, and encryption protocols, is essential. These measures not only safeguard against malicious attacks but also uphold regulatory compliance and foster a secure environment for digital interactions. 

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I found that a challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was initially getting all the necessary components to work together seamlessly in the IDE. Ensuring compatibility and integration among different tools, scripts, and environments required careful configuration and troubleshooting. This process often involved debugging issues related to software versions, dependencies, and conflicting configurations, which demanded patience and meticulous attention to detail. Once these initial hurdles were overcome and the environment was properly set up, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities became more manageable. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
The primary method used to enhance security involved implementing a hash function to generate a unique key for encrypting user data. This approach significantly bolstered the protection of sensitive information stored within the system. By leveraging cryptographic hashing, the system transformed user data into a format that is not easily decipherable without the corresponding key. This cryptographic key serves as a strong barrier against unauthorized access attempts by unauthorized users. Moreover, the use of a hash function enhances data integrity by ensuring that any alterations to the data are immediately detectable. This proactive security measure not only lessens the risk of data breaches but also reinforces user trust in the system's ability to safeguard their personal information. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After I made changes to the code, I conducted a thorough vulnerability test to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced and that the original ones were effectively addressed. This process involved rerunning tests to identify any potential new security weaknesses that might have emerged from the modifications. At the same time, I verified that the measures taken to fix the initial vulnerabilities were strong and successful. By carefully reviewing the updated codebase, I aimed to maintain the system's integrity and resilience against cyber threats, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected and bolstering confidence in the software's security among stakeholders. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
One of the most beneficial resources was researching examples of similar problems online. This approach facilitated a deeper understanding of how these systems operate at a fundamental level, which will be advantageous for tackling future tasks with similar foundational designs, even if they have slightly different requirements.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
One of the most impactful aspects of these assignments for me has been learning about hash functions and their role in enhancing data security. Hash functions are cryptographic tools that transform data into unique, fixed-size strings of characters called hash values. These values are crucial for encrypting sensitive user data such as passwords or transaction details because they ensure that even small changes in input data result in entirely different hash values, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized parties to decipher or manipulate the original information.
